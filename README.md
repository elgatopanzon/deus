# Deus - Godot ECS Pipeline Architecture

This project is an experimental Entity Component System (ECS) and Pipeline architecture built for Godot 4.x. I put this together as an architectural experiment to create highly extensible and modular logic blocks while utilising ECS style code and data access patterns. It's still a WIP.
